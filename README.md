# What is this?

The Grawlix project (a CMS for Webcomics) appears to be abandoned. There has been no activity on the main repo for a few years now. All of the links they had for documentation were broken. I'm trying to breath a little more life into the project.

## Why?

I have a fondess for the project and I know someone who is using it currently. Unfortunately the app does not appear to run well on a more modern version of PHP, it was written for PHP 5.x.

## What is success for this stage of the project

see if I can update it a bit for more modern PHP.

# After success?

After I can get the project working again I aim to:
- make some updates, that will simplify the system
- make it easy to back up
- make it easy to move hosts if desired
