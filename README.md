# What is this?

The Grawlix project (a CMS for Webcomics) appears to be abandoned. There has been no activity on the main repo for a few years now. All of the links they had for documentation were broken.

But I have a fondess for the project and I know someone who is using it currently. Unfortunately the app does not appear to run well on a more modern version of PHP, it was written for PHP 5.x.

I am working to see if I can update it a bit for more modern PHP.

# Who are you?

No one of consequence. I'll put more here later.

# After success?

After I can get the project working again I aim to make some updates, that will simplify the system and hopefully make it easily portable. Meaning it will be easy to back up, and easy to move hosts if desired.
